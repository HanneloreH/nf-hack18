== Cloud environment setup

=== Launch AWS Ec2 instance 

During the training and the hackathon activities we'll use a AWS cloud environment. Follow the following steps to launch your Ec2 instance.

1. SSH in the login instance with this command: 
+
[source,cmd]
----
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \
    -o "UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null" \
    login@52.30.76.104
----

2. Launch your AWS instance with this command: 
+
[source,cmd]
----
curl -fsSL http://bit.ly/launch-ec2 | bash
----

3. When it completes, copy the printed SSH command, _exit_ from the login node (or open a new terminal window) and SSH to the new instance: 
+
[source,cmd]
----
exit
ssh me@<host-name-printed-in-your-screen>
----

4. Clone the following GitHub repository: 
+
[source,cmd]
----
git clone https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-hack18
cd nf-hack18
