This is the documentation for the https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-hack18/tree/master/hackaton[Nextflow 2018 Hackaton] for beginners. This project will cover the implementation of a Variant Calling analysis pipeline for RNA-seq data based on GATK best practices and using Nextflow as the pipeline framework.

It is supposed to be a tutorial project for newbie Nextflow users who are interested in learning how to assemble a real world genomic pipeline with Nextflow, manage dependencies by using container technologies (Docker & Singularity) and deploy the pipeline execution in a reproducible manner to the AWS cloud.
